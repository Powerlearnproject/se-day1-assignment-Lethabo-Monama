Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 software engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, testing and maintaining of software application. Software engineering is important because it creates valuable products, it solves complex problems and it guarantee software is dependable and efficient


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 1. 1940s to 1950s software engineering was introduced
 2. 1960s to 1970s
 3.Agile Methodology emerged in the 2000s, started to break big problems into smaller parts

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance-Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall. it can be used on Projects with low risk of changes,Projects with strict deadlines and budgets..

Agile- Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. must be used on Projects where customer feedback is essential, and on Projects with uncertain or changing requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code eg VS code, IntelliJ
VSC are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, GitHub

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements, tight Deadlines and technical Debt.
To solve overcome these challenges software engineers must have effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts or instructions to guide an AI model in generating desired outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt : Tell me about flowers
Improved prompt: Compare and contrast the characteristics of roses, lilies, and tulips, focusing on their symbolism, growth habits, and ideal care conditions.

It provides a clear and focused direction for the AI, ensuring the generated response is relevant.
